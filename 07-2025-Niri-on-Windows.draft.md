- Niri is a scrollable-tiling window manager.
- It is a Wayland compositor written in Rust.
- Unlike tiling window managers like Sway and Hyprland, it orders windows into columns on an infinite scrolling strip.
- Workspaces are arranged vertically, with unique independent sets for every monitor[^1]
